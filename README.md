Developing AI Systems for Efficient Skill Acquisition and Open-Ended Problem Solving: The ARC Prize 2024 Algorithm

Abstract
Developing Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) capable of open-ended problem solving and rapid skill acquisition has become a focal point in AI research. This study introduces a novel algorithm tailored for the ARC Prize 2024 competition, designed to tackle abstract reasoning tasks using a multi-output ensemble classification model. The algorithm employs ensemble techniques on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) dataset to simulate human-like generalization and adaptability. The model pipeline includes data loading, feature extraction, training, and prediction generation, aiming to produce exactly two solutions for each input. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score reveal promising results, contributing to the advancement of AGI systems applicable across diverse industries. The implications of this work extend beyond the competition, offering potential applications in fields like robotics, manufacturing, and healthcare.
